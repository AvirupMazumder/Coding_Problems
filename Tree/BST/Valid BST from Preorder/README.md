### Problem Description
 
 

You are given a preorder traversal A, of a Binary Search Tree.

Find if it is a valid preorder traversal of a BST.

Note: Binary Search Tree by definition has distinct keys and duplicates in binary search tree are not allowed.


#### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= A[i] <= 10^6

1 <= |A| <= 10^5
```



#### Input Format

```
First and only argument is an integer array A denoting the pre-order traversal.
```

#### Output Format

```
Return an integer:
0 : Impossible preorder traversal of a BST
1 : Possible preorder traversal of a BST
```

##### Example Input

```
Input 1:

A = [7, 7, 10, 10, 9, 5, 2, 8]
```


##### Example Output

```
Output 1:

 0
```
